For main course we ordered Tamarind Fish and Napoleon Chicken. The fish was so soft and delish that I couldn't resist eating even my husband's share. Napoleon Chicken was good too.

Thus I have forever been on a quest to find a quite, beautiful and peaceful place where the food is also perfect.\nAnd I think I have just found the...place... Heard about this from a friend of mine who is a model celebrity, her words were, \"Many people from the showbiz industry and other celebrities usually visit this place called Lalafy Eatery because of the privacy that place has and basically the vibe.. I mean no one disturbs you by coming up to you for a selfie or an autograph even if they recognise you!\"\n\nWe went there, it was way beyond our expectations. The glass floor, the flowers and greenery, the artful decor; everything, every detail was perfectly choreographed. And the food complimented it. I mean they've got an Italian style live Wood Oven for Pizza and Steak and a trained mixologist at the bar for drinks made with Non Alchoholic Malt Beer: how authentic is that and they taste damn good.\nI was on a diet so I ordered Polo Green from their Clay Pot menu (a calorie calculated and controlled diet menu) and a friend ordered a burger from the Burger Expediment menu and two others shared a margherita pizza... I testify on behalf of the taste of my crew that the food was actually exceptional.MoreWe are happy to hear that you loved place and the food so much....

We had a new branch open up close to our house but since it was a sunday and only car dine in was allowed so thought to go to liberty market which does have a few dishes extra to their menu. \n\nOne of the best feature of coming here is that u can get desi, continental and chinese cuisine and the 2 i have tried on this visit were exceptional. Actually this is the place which started this all cuisines under 1 roof but sadly no other restaurant has been able to match its standards.\n\nWe ordered a VIP Desi platter which has the 2nd best chicken kebabs, i mean really ! Soft and juicy, Chicken boti was ok and nothing bad can be said about it, a serving of handi was a bit oily but tasted good, soft and moist nans and the best vegetable biryani with cooked potatoes, onions and beetroot added after cooking leaving them crisp and tasty and was the best I have tried in a long time.\n2nd dish was again a platter consisting of fried chicken sandwich which had fresh greens and really nicely done fried chicken, a couple of nuggets which were 2.5 times bigger than McD and tasted nice aswell for nuggets. Fries were crisp chunkier then usual burger chains and not dripping with oil. Pineapple and apple salad was fresh also.\nBoth the platters were served with a serving of desert of your choice also.  Both of the platters are funny sized, i mean 1 person cant have it all but for 2 it will not be adequate so these platters are for 1.5 people.\n3rd item was the famous and pioneering stuffed chicken breast with herb butter, the server was kind enough to get black mushroom sauce with it rather then the usual pineapple sauce which is bit on sweeter side. I tell you it still tastes great just like before and the biggest chicken breast portion in town.\nThe last item we ordered was the all time favourite Club sandwich and yes it was great too.\n\nAll in all i would definitely recommend this place when there is a tie between going to a desi or a continental restaurant coz all of the family members can get whatever they like. Hopefully will soon visit again and try their chinese menu and update u guys about it also.More"},{"reviewerName":"OmerRON","ratingDate":"August 31, 2020","reviewHeading":"Best Taste Food 🥘 Calm n Tradational","reviewText":"Best taste in downtown of Lahore that is Liberty.

Some of the dishes I tried at Fuchsia Kitchen were a treat for my taste buds. Afterwards, washed down the food with incredibly delicious Fresh Pomegranate Juice. \n\nI Started with a steaming bowl of Hot & Sour Prawn Soup, a light soup with fragrant asian flavours and succulent prawns, a little watery though.\n\nChicken Wonton were served in the bamboo steamer basket with tangy dipping sauce. These pretty little parcels were filled with juicy minced chicken and a crown of peas added a fresh touch.\n\nWasabi Prawns were moreish, bursting with savoury and spicy flavours. This is a starter you'll want again and again.\n\nAfter starters, we moved on to the main course. Beloved Thai dish Wok Fried Chicken with Holy Basil and Vegetables was fabulous, lightly spiced and the distinctive flavour of holy basil was fantastic.\n\nRed Curry Prawns was delicious and full of flavour, the sweetness of coconut milk nicely complemented the spiciness of the vibrant curry.\n\nChicken Cashew Nuts had a lovely savoury flavour. I just missed an essential component of this dish, of course the cashews. This stir fried dish was not finished with good amount of roasted cashews.\n\nChicken Manchurian was a wonderful dish with just the right touch of sweetness. Tender diced chicken, half cooked veggies perfectly blend with a tomato based gravy. \n\nMongolian Beef was a mouth watering entree. The glossy, sticky, sweet sauce nicely coated every slice of juicy beef.\n\nFlavoursome Egg Fried Rice loaded with colourful veggies, was the perfect complement to the main course gravies.\n\nScrumptious desserts was a beautiful ending to this gastronomic experience. \nRich, moist slice of Fudge cake was utterly chocolatey and truly charming. Crispy Chocolate Rolls were pretty good, filled with warm gooey melted chocolate.\nBread Pudding was creamy, perfectly sweetened and spiced. Tiramisu was soft, airy with just the right sweetness. \n\nYou will no doubt enjoy an all round pan asian experience at this upmarket establishment.More"},{"reviewerName":"JANNAT04","ratingDate":"March 17, 2019","reviewHeading":"After making waves in Karachi, it’s time for Lahore now.","reviewText":"After making waves in Karachi, Fuchsia Kitchen opened its door in Lahore almost 1 year ago. It was my third visit there but this time it was with evaluative eye.    \n\nIt’s a spacious, comfy and well managed platform in the foodies city with a warm...reception power. This place is a perfect example of a true Pan Asian Dining. From the ambiance to the food to staff, Fuchsia serves as a desirable model for all eateries out there. \n\nNow coming towards the real thing i.e “FOOD” We began our meal with the choice of soup. I opted for Hot and Sour Soup with Prawns. It was great and perfect to have in Chilly Season. Meanwhile I was enjoying the pleasure of soup, the waiter came to take drinks order. I ordered “Mint Margarita”. It had the right amount of mint, with adequate amount of lime and soda. And look at that icy texture. \n\nIn starters we had:\n* Dry Beef and Crispy Taro; combination of beef and crispy noodles was luscious.\n* Prawn and Mushroom Dim-sum; it vanished away the moment I took it’s picture. Heard they were great too. \n* Jumbo Prawns: the first thing I tried as prawns are my weakness. And that sweet chilly sauce served along made me desired it more. But main item was on it’s way that I stopped desiring. \nIn mains we had:\n* Cashewnut Chicken; It tasted perfectly according to my taste buds with very little or maybe no cashews. 🤭\n\n* Chicken Manchurian; It was average by taste but the typical red Manchurian color made it attractive to eat. \n* Wok-Fried Chicken with Holly Basil and Vegetables; The subtle peppery flavour of this dish made it compete it’s name. And the aroma of basil made me fall in love at first smell/sight.\n* Stir Fried Chicken; it was scrumptious especially the stir fried vegetables mixed with it. \n* The Rice Guy; I loved the idea of a guy serving complimentary steaming hot, sticky rice with mains. They were best and light on stomach.\n\nNow last but not the least, let’s review my favourite most part of food i.e “DESSERT”. In desserts we had: \n* Bread and Butter Pudding; Served with vanilla ice-cream. The caramel sauce on it was semi-sweet and having it with ice-cream balanced it’s sweetness. \n* Tiramisu; It was one of the best Tiramisu I ever had despite the fact ladyfingers were overly soaked in coffee syrup. That made it over soggy. \n* Crispy Chocolate Rolls; served with Japanese green tea ice-cream was a showstopper of all the starters, mains and desserts. Nutty and Fudge chocolate sauce covered in roll, deep fried and served hot. The 3C’s, crunch, crisp and chocolate, made it worth trying. \n\nSo all in all, the Fuchsia experience was astounding. From entering it’s building till paying the bill (which shows the value for money), all is worth it. It’s highly recommended. 👍More"},{"reviewerName":"shahid992019","ratingDate":"March 12, 2019","reviewHeading":"Pan Asian fine dining restaurant","reviewText":"'Fuchsia Kitchen' a perfect addition to the Lahore’s extraordinary food horizon. New favourite, i must say. It’s quiet spacious, built in a beautiful and huge converted villa with al fresco sitting, a well lit place for a fine-dine experience with no hustle bustle. I actually...found the ambiance and environment astonishing - peaceful and serene. \n\n✔Starters.\nSo i started with some usually suspected starters. ‘Chicken corn soup’ a mainstream pick and a mainstay in everyone’s average food pantry. It was served fresh and steamy with choosy ingredients meticulously melded together. \n\nOther than that, a delicious Chinese dim sum dish ‘Prawn Toasts’ was served in  triangular shaped bread form structure quoted with minced prawns, as the name suggests. Definite crowd pleaser. \n\nWhereas, wasabi prawns were exquisite with piquant and tangy essence of sauces exploding from within, a must try!! \n \n✔Mains.\nComing forward to my favourite part, the main courses. Everything was finger licking good, i was delighted. \nIf you crave for Thai, Chinese or Veitnamese food then this is the place to explore, mark my words. \n\nRed Cury prawn was hands down a perfect dish. It was delightful and full of surprises because of it’s variety of tangy and vinegary sauces within. Also a perfect combination of coconut cream and red thai curry paste.\n\nGreen Curry Chicken was totally an aromatic dish, one of the most exciting dish I’ve ever had. I loved how ingredients including fish sauce, ginger with vegetables was perfectly adjusted by the amount of coconut milk used with chunks of tender chicken simmered in the green sauce. \n\nWok fried chicken was beautifully served with colourful vegetables which made it look better even before tasting. The fried chicken entree’s were enveloped by pulpy tongue tingling sauce. \n\nCashew Nut Chicken was mouthwatering itself. Supply chunks of chicken combined with crispy roasted cashews topped with an appetising thick garlic sauce left me with no words. Yummiest!!\n\nMongolian beef was as tasty as it could be, excellent if spice doesn’t hit your taste buds right. Beef was without doubt fresh and juicy placed with scallions seasoned vegetables.\n\n✔Desserts.\nDesserts are a must since lunch is incomplete without it so I ordered their Chocolate Fudge Cake, Crispy Chocolate Rolls and Bread Pudding to put a happy ending to my mind-boggling experience. I am a dessert person, having tried desserts from cuisines all around i’d rate their fudge cake 7/10, could’ve been better though. \nWhereas their crispy chocolate rolls were heart stopping, perfect with sweltering melted sauce. \nBread pudding isn’t something to be missed.

They started with nans and then their trademark whole  wheat burgers.\n\nI visited this brand after a couple of years...and was happy to see such an extended menu. Ordered their beef naans which was like a beef pizza where the meat immediately fell off the moment u picked it up. What a disappointment! Kasturi boti  was below average and beef kebabs are better served in H block market of dha. Patakha chicken was anything but patakha, just a lame spin off of the famous dish of nathia gali with a completely different taste and all. The only saving grace, that too after showing all this to the manager was the special meetha nan, it was good.\n\nI messaged them with the complaint on FB and was replied by an automated message and nothing else. It used to be an owner run place where he would take feedback and look after all the guests but now it's just another business with poor management.  I don't like to give bad reviews but I hope this might catch the eye of the owner and he pulls up his socks before winters come in which is the best business time for his brand.More"},{"reviewerName":"mariajabeen","ratingDate":"March 12, 2019","reviewHeading":"Organic and Hygienic desi variety","reviewText":"Went here 4-5 times now.

The location is off-the-grid which is good coz' wasn't much hustle there.\n\nWe had an advance booking and order (the...organic \"aseel\" chicken takes time in getting tender) was steaming ready when we arrived. The service was superb with waiters serving next item as soon as a round completed.\n\nThe price was steep given the location but once we started eating, the only thing that captured our senses was the food. Their mutton chops were one of the finest I ever had and were the most beautifully cut I ever sampled (Graphic Design perhaps). The aseel/organic chicken in shorba/soup was the highlight of the evening alongwith the chops and Meetha/sweet naan.\n\nWould go there again any day of the week.

The moment you taste kebab, you can identify the true taste of lamb (Chattra). Boti (8 good size pieces per dish) was also...mouthwatering with a slight taste of malai booti. Although bit high in price but worth the money. The order (1 kebab + Boti plate) was sufficient for two adults for a late night dinner but took about 30 minutes in preparation. Presentation was simple but thoughtfully sourced as food was presented in butter paper to keep warm and safe. Located in a quite residential area and not easily accessible in night as the street gates are locked, adequate seating available inside and outside.

The owner is a lovely gentleman who's very hands on and into food. Fed us keema nans which were not bad and culchas which were very good. We also had lamb chops which were seasoned well, not over done. Had a beef...burger. The patti was very good. Overall a good burger but the bun is too bready and takes away from the overall beef experience. He's also taken out a chicken burger which is quite good if you are into chicken burgers.

Must visit.More"},{"reviewerName":"NJLahori","ratingDate":"October 9, 2015","reviewHeading":"Votta Burger! Votta chops! Votta place!","reviewText":"Votta burger!\nVotta lamb chops.\nI dont eat burgers in Pak land unless they are desi buRgerrrs. The quality of local burgers never really satisfies me. Usually burgers here = Tightly packed over done patty, drowned in mayo (which I ONLY like used intelligently in...coleslaw or potatoes salad) and a slightly sweet always too floury bun, squishing it all together. Ooh don't forget soggy lettuce and huge chunk of tomato that tastes of mayo also. I wasn't ready to enjoy the burger at Bake n Grill. But I was quite overwhelmed and taken utterly by surprise.\nIt looks fantastic. It tastes fantastic. It is fantastic. A juicy melt in your \nmouth patty of incredible quality ochargrilled beef, in a glorious brown mostly bran yet incredibly soft bun, some crunchy onion and anything else the customer wants. \nWhat's really insane is the quality of the beef patty. It ROCKS! This is a burger im already having cravings for and I ate enough for a small army today. Another excellent quality to this burger is it doesn't leave you feeling greased out or so heavy you want to be ill. Just leaves you satisfied and full. Until you remember what it was like to bite through it and your craving another one.\n\nThe chops at Grill and Bake were always good but today I went after a few months and they were exceptionally soft, succulent and malai like to eat! Divine! Not glazed or oiled with anything at all, just juicy in their own natural fat.\n\nThe wholewheat qeema naans were also gorgeous. They have an incredible mutton flavour filling in a wholewheat sesame seeded kulcha dipped in raita.\nOne of the best qeema naans I've ever had! Also the kulchas don't have that gooey kacha maida after taste. They are crunchy on the outside and soft inside and eaten hot with raita or this incredible dahi malai I had! The dahi malai is some thing else! It has this texture that's a cross between the freshest Burratta and Philadelphia cheese spread. More towards the burrata. The dahi gives that texture and tanginess to the malai and dipped with a kulcha shining in desi ghee, it's a bite of pure khaalis heaven.\n\nI would also recommend if you go to Grill and Bake don't leave without trying their GuR/shakar kulcha. A perfect desi pizza touched with the taste of old school choori, because of the desi ghee and shakar.\n\nThe frothy chilled shakar lassi is also incredible!! One of the most refreshing drinks I've had in a long long time! Before winters hit you, down the lassi!! It literally straightest your spine and leaves you with that aaaaaaah freshshshsh feeling.\n\nFinally end the meal with the perfect cup of tea. Few places serve awesome burgers, chops AND serve the quintessential perfect cuppa desi chai. Bake and Grill have created a perfect blend of their fav tea and its Wah!!\n\nThank God for Grill and Bake! \nThe owner Afrin is a gentleman who loves good food and lome a true desi, loves to share and feed great food! Had to let you guys in on my amazing evening dearest foodie family!More"},{"reviewerName":"osmanalvi","ratingDate":"September 29, 2015","reviewHeading":"Excellent","reviewText":"Excellent and memorable visit...\nA bit.....expensive.\n But exceptional. \nThe owner put his ideas,  new ideas together.And re-vamped Desi into Cintinental style..Like Sweet Naan.\nWholemeal Naan.

Perfectly roasted chicken with ricotta cheese & spinach. I personally like the spinach and pesto due to unique flavor. The sandwich was bran bread so its a healthy option for weight watchers.

The chicken was amazingly done. So juicy, crusty and full of flavours, literally takes you to the seventh sky and enough to make your day😋i would rate it 9/10 Rs 599+tax\n▶The Strawberry Mojito was surely refreshing but it has a hint of lemon which makes it a bit tangy. Didn't liked it much. I think i should stick to Mint Margarita😜 Rs 299+tax\n▶For dessert, i choosed their mini cheesecake. Oh what a beauty it was! So soft literally melts in mouth.

Just anything. Than it took constant bantering of the staff to get the buffet ready almost 30 mins late but if the food was any good this could have been excused. Salads were good. the accompanying sandwiches looked good and with rich filling but filled with extra salt. ok. no big deal they were just sandwiches. The chicken pockets were so soft or soggy that everyone tried to take them but almost all of them crumble. Than comes the highlight of disaster, bar bq kababs ! There was less meat and more salt in them, everyone left them as it was impossible to eat them, the manager said he will get them changed but that did not happen. Prawns were ok, nothing special, soggy batter, spring rolls had a new color, black ! Burnt to a crisp and the audacity of the staff to put them up there was amazing. Chicken tarragon was good amongst the other disasters. KFC style chicken on sticks was also good, not oily at all and as crispy as can be.  Than came the gravy, fish and chicken, both had similar sauce which was pointless. Fish had an odor and an after taste, again complained, even the host also shouted bout it but to no avail. \n\nDessert was something which was a blessing after such poor serving of the buffet. Chocolate cake was fresh and creamy, banofie pie was also good with the right amount of sugar in it.\n\nAll in all i would prefer not to waste my money on this restaurant anymore, there hygiene was always an issue but now the food quality has really deteriorated, seems like the cook has found salt treasure and prefers to use it over all the other spices.More"},{"reviewerName":"Haris R","ratingDate":"January 1, 2020","reviewHeading":"DECENT FOOD BUT UNHYGEINE","reviewText":"Overall i loved their hi tea buffet the main things which i dislike the most that they did not add any salt or condiments in their prawns tempura so that people were unable to eat, secondly i found an iron wool in my penne pasta...which i also show their staff but they do not even bother.

Howdy, foodies! Name’s Yahya Nouman and I like to do a lot of cooking around these parts.  However, today we are not going to be cooking but today we...are going to be looking and tasting the food at Howdy. It’s a new restaurant that opened a branch in Pakistan. Moreover, it has a ‘wild-west’ theme alongside many different props and murals that encourage the ‘wild-west’ saloon and bar theme. Today, we are going to be taking a close look at whether this, what the kids call it these days, the cool restaurant is actually worth droppin’ in.\n\nWell, today you are reading no ordinary magazine. I, Yahya Nouman, prepared some tests that the staff took unknowingly. These tests actually spill the beans. So make sure to read till the end. I am also going to present my review in an anecdote format where I stop at each step to provide my feedback and evidence.\n\nThe criteria on which I will be judging have certain reasons and are as follows. Firstly, I am going to be judging the restaurant by its food quantity, price, and quality. The main reason here is food is why most people go to this restaurant and they expect a good, sizable portion which is also reasonably priced. Secondly, I am going to be judging the atmosphere and how people feel while eating here. This is mainly because people know the type of environment and whether this place is right up their alley. Moreover, it helps people know and understand the place and whether they want to spend time here. Finally, I will be looking at all the tiny details and whether the staff is helpful or not.\n\nAs I was making my way to Howdy on the top floor, I was already fantasizing about how it would be. And my brain would go on and on classifying every detail about everything. However, when I walked inside, it was far formed I imagined. The door was made of batwing doors of the typical saloon doors. On my left side, there was a bar wedged in the corner that had everything but alcohol! There were window-panes that made up the whole right wall. There was a ‘wild-west’ themed seating from barrels to horses to sit on. There were several murals showing cowboys in very daring poses. There was also the same set-up on the balcony which had a clear view of M.M Alam Road. There were also 2 T.V’s showing a live cricket match. There were also several cowboy equipment such as ropes, paper mache bullheads, and guns. My view of how it was are as follows; crowded, cool, a bit vulgar, active and bustling. I say so because it was a bit cramped with a lot of tables and seats and there we also a lot of people. There were a few vulgar terms but overall it was like any fastFood place just a tad quieter.\n\nHere we come to our first test. As I was seated, I decided to put a test into action. I took a fork, placed it on the floor and waited for the waiters to notice and hand me a fresh spoon. I am sad to report that they failed this test and never bothered to even notice it. It is my theory that it is so because of a couple of reasons. Firstly, he may have a lot on his mind and didn’t quite notice or the restaurant didn’t pay that attention to hygiene. All I can say is that it affected my experience in a negative manner. After a while, I got seated and a waiter came forward to take my order. Those of you who know me that I really like spicy food. Therefore, when he came forward I told him that I really like spicy food and asked him the spiciest burger on the menu. He suggested the Rango Tango, a medium-rare jalapeno grilled burger. I also ordered some fries and a soft drink. The wait time wasn’t long, 10 mins at most.\n\nWhile I waited for my burger to arrive, I started thinking about the chemistry behind a burger. First the bun, Let’s start by kneading the dough, which in terms of chemistry is more than just mixing flour and water. These mechanics are necessary for the several proteins to settle in layers surrounding starch granules and give the dough its characteristic consistency.Then we just have to bake. And by the way, the golden-brown colour of bread after baking is the result of the Maillard reaction, so named after the chemist who found that the heat of the oven causes a reaction between amino acids and sugars which gives a golden colour to baked goods. Secondly, the cheese, casein likes to gather into clumps called micelles. The molecules making up the proteins have sections with a  negative charge on them.These sections point out of the micelle, toward the watery part of the milk. The sections with no charge point toward the inside of the micelle, away from the water. Acids are a class of positively-charged molecules. When you add these to the milk, they neutralize the negatively-charged casein molecules. Without their negative charges, the casein molecules do not stay easily dissolved in the water. So as I added the buttermilk to my milk, its lactic acid began reacting with the casein, creating clumps. Now the condiments are examples of emulsion. An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible. Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of matter called colloids. Finally we have the meat, which is basically protein straightened out with heat.\n\nWhen the food arrived, it blew me away. Firstly, I want to talk about the presentation of the dish and how the food placement affected the food experience overall. Food presentation is just as essential to the success of a dish as its taste and flavor. The way the food looks on the plate is what tempts our eyes and makes you want to taste it. Imagine how your room looks when it’s messy and how it looks when you clean it up, the same ingredients, different results. It is just as true with food presentation and how the elements are arranged on the plate. The plating was phenomenal. Let me paint the picture for you, the burger’s top bun was resting on the side of the burger. On the bottom bun, there is a perfect medium-rare cooked buffalo chicken, with juicy veggies such as tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and jalapenos. The food was cooked to perfection. It was designed as a Master Chef would plate the food. All the elements of a perfect burger were there.\n\nWhether it is the seasoning, the sauce, the type of pickle, the type of cheese, the amount of tomato, or just the fact that you want to have more of it, every burger can taste delectable in its own unique way. This burger was just perfect! The burger was a wild ride all the way through. The spices were just incredible and my eyes were burning alongside a beautiful smell and amazing grill marks. It had all the elements and tasted amazing. A fresh and crispy bun, lettuce leaves, pickles, onion and a small patty flavored with mayonnaise and ketchup. The quantity was reasonably enough for a person. But alas, every meal must come to an end. It was reasonably priced at Rs. 500.\n\nSo in conclusion, Howdy is a great place to come, hang out and eat. We went over all the finer points of the restaurant and decided over what was good and bad. We also told the results of several tests that happened and how the Howdy staff reacted. We also went over the ambiance and the mood to be there. Owing to the amazing performance of the staff at Howdy, it can be safe to say that it can be known as the best restaurant in the world!More"},{"reviewerName":"blogby_aws","ratingDate":"January 28, 2020","reviewHeading":"Amazing Sandwiches","reviewText":"We know how big Howdy have become but one thing they haven’t compromised is their Taste.

In fact the food was so good that I returned twice,...including inviting my father here especially for his birthday (no easy feat as he lives 4 hours away and avoids Lahore like the plague!). Even he loved the food and said it was worth the trip! \n\nSo...what did we have? We ordered: Chicken Lettuce Wrap and Dynamite Shrimps for starters. Sesame Chicken (quite sweet in flavor but outstanding nevertheless), Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao Chicken (slightly too spicy for me but still delicious!) for our mains. The taste of the food we ordered is just indescribable. I have never been to PF Chang's (including foreign locations) prior to this so I don't know how it compares to other branches, all I do know is that both myself and my father still talk about this food 4 months later. \n\nI had the chance to dine at some fantastic restaurants whilst in Lahore and I have to say this is the only one I kept coming back to. Admittedly, the interior decor, seating etc wasn't the best, when compared to, say, Aylanto, but don't let that put you off...the food and the service (kudos to our waiter for recommending all the above items) is heads and shoulders above what you'll experience in other restaurants here.

Who has not tried it on their plenty of visits to dubai or usa! Dynamite prawns was a phenomenon made famous them so it was natural for seafood lovers or chinese food lovers to look upto its opening.\nExterior- was grand and looked worth...the penny, interior was again grand, one huge space with plenty of seats. It definitely looked apart from gulberg chinese restaurants gangs all around it, there was definitely a new kid on the block to give the old guard a tough time.\n\nThe moment u looked at the menu it was clear that this was an ambitious project, the prices compared to the local restaurants were very high ( u cannot simply put a menu by converting the dirhams or the dollars into pkr). To keep this restaurant filled after the initial craze would be a tough ask with these steep prices, there is only one way to do that  and that was to give the best quality food ! Dynamites shrimp copycats of lahore should be embarrassed by their food, the beef chilli dry should be as jiucy and tender as it could be ! All those expectations came crashing down the moment the appetizer was served, cold and over cooked shrimps. That was it for me but still i hang around to complete the order. To tell u honestly there was nothing worth the wait or the price! \nNOw the grand hall seemed like a nuisance as it felt like a fish market with the lahori weekend crowd talking at the top of their volume. Beef was again at room temperature and the soup was average. \nHence proven that if the food is not upto the mark all the ambiance and grand decor seems like a waste and can get on ur nerves instead.

The fish dishes are more expensive. What is odd that the food is served on wooden platters covered with waxed paper and not on regular dishes.

The small sector shop area has turned out to be one of those small eatries...niche area which started from dessert directory and G.Y.M. and then expanded to a couple more joints. \nNovu on a saturday evening was pretty bz keeping in mind it only has 4 tables, 4 inside and 2 on the terrace. \nWe were 4 pple and ordered the novu special fish, two beef entrees, all 3 with sticky garlic rice and one chicken entree with noodles. Noodles were exceptional and the chicken ordinary. A restaurant is always judged by me by the quality and cooking of beef, both were exceptional here. Novu fish was something different, a bit spicy and a bit tangy so i will give it good marks for being innovative. Chicken salad was very good and dynamite shrimps were ......err just dynamite shrimps, copy of the famous pf changs which even the local version of pf changs cannot do right so cant blame NOVU for not doing it the right way instead just adding thousand island sauce to mayonnaise kinda taste. \nThe only thing missing here was the courtesy which is synonymous to such a small restaurant.  The head waiter refused to place the order of chicken salad and dynamite shrimps ahead of the main order by giving the excuse that the chef gets confused if one table has two separate orders!!!! Just lame ! Owner missing from action kinda excuse. But still i would suggest to give it a shot for a change of taste and spices.

The crowds were thinner and I enjoyed this respite...from the heat of Lahore in late May of 2017.  I was here with a friend for a late lunch after a five-hour trip from another part of Pakistan and my aching back indeed needed a comfy chair.\nThis restaurant is located on a street in the fashionable upscale neighborhood of Gulberg and is patronized mostly by the upper crust of the Pakistani society. \nIt is another subject that linguistically the name “La Atrium” seemed a bit confusing, because it should have been L’Atrium... to be correct, but then Pakistani is a place that is far from being a francophone. \nWe were graciously seated by the host next to an upright air conditioner and a buffet of more than 30 entrees awaited us to indulge in… to our hearts desire along with a welcome drink, albeit non-alcoholic, following the tradition of this Muslim land. \nThe buffet was mostly Pakistani cuisine with a small smattering of international dishes such as Thai gravy, pasta, panini, buffalo wings and the ever-present Western deserts, complete with the Mexican flan that has always been my favorite, making me reminisce my other visits to places south of the border. I tried almost everything and it was not only sumptuous but salubrious as well. There was not a single dish that I could complain about.\nThe staff was courteous and helpful. \nI would have given this restaurant five stars but I found the following issues that in my opinion the management must address. The problems are mostly related to aesthetic, and down right pleasant. \nAlthough the rest rooms were inconveniently located outside the building of the main dining hall, if one assumed the garden-like atmosphere, that could be overlooked. However, I did feel a blast of 114-degree warm air, once I exited the restaurant and I do believe that the restrooms could be included in the interior of the building, especially if any future re-modelling was in the plans.\nThe restrooms were dirty and were ignored. For this review, I visited all the four stalls in the men’s restroom. The flush did not work in one of those and the restroom was dilapidated, unfitting a restaurant of this standard. The trim from the mirror had fallen off laying on the counter and the mirrors had not been cleansed... what appeared to be at least for weeks. No attendant was on duty and the toilet paper was unavailable. Toilets were disgustingly filthy with smell of human waste in the air. I may be attaching pictures for the management to see if that is possible.More"},{"reviewerName":"shoaibfarrukh","ratingDate":"February 13, 2017","reviewHeading":"La Atrium Lunch Buffet","reviewText":"Visited couple of times for a lunch buffet at La Atrium, Gulberg.

As the name suggested it would be an authentic steakhouse with proper doneness graduations and yes they knew the difference between them.\nI ordered a beef steak and wife ordered the stuffed chicken steak. My beef...steak came in at room temperature which was a pure disappointment but this is where it gets better. I informed the manager of the issue and he immediately admitted the mistake and told me that he will warm it but I insisted that as i ordered a medium rare and reheating will cook it more and it will be chewy and dry upon which he said that I can keep the steak with me and enjoy the sides while he brings me a fresh new steak. I was disappointed that I will have to finish my sides by then but to my surprise they served me a complete meal again with fresh new sides also and the this time the steak was piping hot and cooked as desired. Everyone can make mistakes but its how you handle the situation that makes the difference and they handled it exceptionally well. Their mac n cheese was bland but all other sides including fries and mashed potatoes were excellent. The steak was juicy and tender as requested. Their stuffed chicken steak was exceptional also and better then any other chicken steak we have tried anywhere, had nice flavour to it.\n\nWill totally recommend it but order according to your taste.

Just when I had all but given up on Lahore food offerings, KK comes along to spice things up.\n\nEvery thing about...the place shows the thought that has gone into it.\n\nThough small, the place is contemporary, clean and sports an open vibe. The decor reflects the Karachi theme and the tunes playing are hand picked and played at just the right volume to add to the experience without jarring.\n\nThe food reflects a genuine curation of some Karachi favourites like Bun Kabab, Paratha Rolls, Biryani, Haleem and Bihari. I tried several and loved them all. While the taste of each offering matches the best we had growing up, the quality of ingredients and hygiene is a cut above.\n\nThe Bun Kabab is fresh, with a tangy spicy green chatni, piyaz, a well seasoned patty nestled in a soft lightly tawa heated bun. One can easily have a few of just those and come away happy. But then that would risk leaving out the delicious paratha rolls which wrap moist and tender meat offerings, with excellent chutney in a moist paratha that holds it all together without getting soggy and falling apart. This is a place where one can keep eating the varied offerings without realising the serious overeating going on.\n\nWashing it all down with a chilled Coke from the fridge is a bonus treat (I don't like Pepsi and don't appreciate restaurants that offer only Pepsi for the marketing deals it offers).\n\nNow we need KK in Karachi itself.More"},{"reviewerName":"HaiderA375","ratingDate":"September 29, 2018","reviewHeading":"Best Bun Kebabs in Lahore","reviewText":"This place has the best Bun Kebabs in Lahore.

For the love of Japanese food, We visited Japanese and Thai Restaurant “Asian Aroma” in Park Lane Hotel situated on one of the most busiest road in Gulberg Lahore. Beautifully...designed and the neutral colours around were complimenting the fine dining experience with availability of live Teppanyaki Counter. When the ambience is natural and comfortable, I find it unforgettable.\n\nThe menu pages are thick with a variety of dishes including Japanese Shusi (Raw fish with rice), Teppanyaki (with choices of Beef, Chicken and Red Snapper) , Thai and Chinese but the overall dining experience was not which our taste buds were looking for. \n\nThe best i could find were their Spring Rolls and Jumbo Prawns for starters. In the mains the best was Beef Teppanyaki (Although its texture was very different from the actual Teppanyaki) and Egg fried rice was made to perfection which is usually considered as a side order now a days with no attention to the details it requires. Let me evaluate all the dishes we had in more details.\n\n> Hot & Sour Soup- Saltless with loads of cornflour but served with fresh crispy complimentary Crackers. 3/10 for soup 10/10 for crackers\n\n> Jumbo Prawn Tempura- Real jumbo sized prawns are a rare find now a days in our restaurants. They were coated with crispy batter. (8/10)\n\n> Spring Rolls- Rite amount of oil with vegetables, chicken and Sauce made them the must have at this place (9/10)\n\n> Wasabi Chicken- Overdosed with wasabi sauce, the finger sized chicken pieces couldn’t blend with the sauce (4/10)\n\n> Poocha- Want to try something different? Then order this cutlets which also have crab meat in it and will definitely give you a Desi taste in a Thai dish (7/10)\n\n> Sushi Platter- Included Crunchy Maki, California Maki and Salmon Rolls. Sushi is raw fish filled with rice but as i am not a sushi lover so I want rate this dish. The making of sushi itself was great learning experience for me. \n\n> Teppanyaki Counter- We tried in all three flavours; Beef, Chicken & Fish ( Red Snipper). Perhaps the best part of our visit was the learning experience of making of this famous Japanese dish. The chef cooked Teppanyaki on Teppan in-front of us. The main ingredients of Teppanyaki were Beef/Seafood/Chicken with Chopped Garlic, Soybean Oil, SoyaSauce, Japanese salt & Sautéed Vegetables served with garlic fried rice. Beef was the best among all three and was well cooked and chewable.6.5/10\n\n> American ChopSuey- Layers of ketchup and chicken which seemed to hate each other in the company of The noodles. (4/10)\n\n> Chicken ChowMien- Could have been a better treat if Oil was less (3/10)\n\n> Egg Fried Rice:  The quality of rice used were great and as i already compliment above, It was made to perfection. (8/10)\n\n> Pavlova (Desert)- Topped with strawberry chunk and whipped cream, it was crispy on the out and soft from the inside and lite on the tummy. (7/10) \n\nThere were more dishes as well but i was on a full stomach by then that I couldn’t even taste them. \n\nSummarising the story, experience was average. Great to learn the making of Teppanyaki and Sushi but will not suggest to visit this place to anyone. \nOverall rating= 4/10More"}]},{"name":"Cafe Chuski","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/15/af/8c/c3/tribute.jpg","rating":"3 ","address":"MM Alam Road, Hussain Chowk Gulberg III 58-B/3 Hussain Chowk Gulberg III","cuisines":"middleEastern, Pakistani","reviews":[{"reviewerName":"mariajabeen","ratingDate":"April 5, 2019","reviewHeading":"Cool interior","reviewText":"This place has a vibrant interior and popular among young lot for having some good tea, snacks and hang out.

I was very curious as to how good this place must be that  we get bookings for 5 people after...2 weeks.\n\nWhen we reached there one thing was obvious as to why the wait was long, the place is very small, hardly 70-80 people sitting area was available. The second thing which was why the place is heavily booked is that the quality of the food is exceptional, the samosas were light and dry as it could be, the croissant sandwiches were fluffy and again light as they could be! Potato cubes (batata) were neat and tasty, chicken boti was masala dar and very well marinated. Haleem in chicken is never good for me so i wont comment on it :) Sweet and sour chicken is the most pathetic i have ever had which was a big surprise to me, it was not even average but extremely below average. The salads and sandwiches and dahi phulkis everything was good. Sliders were nothing great and the nans were an inch thick !!! Just like the mini pizza dough, there is something they need to fix in the bread section.\n\nNow i will come to the high light of the buffet, anda chana !!!!! I have never had this good anda chana at a dhaba restaurant let alone a fancy place like nishat, the best anda chana hands down by a huge margin. The occampanying puris were crispy and light, if only the nans were this good also.\n\nNow about dessert, I have always said that the cheese cake at nishat is the best and yet again they proved me right, light, fluffy crusted and with a cherry on top! The best ! Every other dessert was as good as they could be, second best of mine would be the chocolate tarts. I have to say that if any place could compete with veranda bistro and East in the desert section it would be The bistro at NIshat. \n\nA must try place but dont go on a weekend as the crowd is not very nice with kids and adults over flowing their plates and than wasting everything. It was such a poor sight that it almost ruined my trip had the food not been this clean and good.More"}]},{"name":"MariBelle","rating":"4 ","address":"94-D Mall 1, Main Boulevard","cuisines":"Cafe, French, British, Contemporary, Healthy","reviews":[{"reviewerName":"rana_irfan82","ratingDate":"January 19, 2020","reviewHeading":"Review","reviewText":"They have such a cool ambience,nice food with such a picturesque setting...i couldnt try their dessert but i can tell it would be awesomely good"}]},{"name":"New York Coffee","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-i/19/98/72/ae/10.jpg","rating":"4 ","address":"Walton Road Level 2 , Packages Mall","cuisines":"Cafe, Bar, Asian, Pub, Eastern European, Armenian, centralAsian","reviews":[{"reviewerName":"blogby_aws","ratingDate":"October 11, 2019","reviewHeading":"Enjoyed","reviewText":"New York Coffee-Packages Mall\n———————————————\nIn Mood of a Chilled Drink and Yummy Desert while Shooing in the biggest Mall in Lahore?New York Coffee is the place to go.

And main beverage was mint margaritas which  you can have unlimited refill without any additional charges. \nBad: The only thing which I observed there was the congested environment.

The caramel was simply pathetic and pastries were just stale.\nWelcome drinks are not offered anymore was an unpleasant surprise.\nPakistani Dishes (Lahori Chargha, Kababs, BBQ, White Karahi) were below averageMore"},{"reviewerName":"Azher_Ali_Choudhry","ratingDate":"May 1, 2022","reviewHeading":"An insult to Lahori food.","reviewText":"We went for sahri.
